# Script Folder

This folder is for system admin usage.

# CV Script

In order to speed up conversion of Markdown
files to HTML, I'm using `pandoc`.

This script permits you to convert a single
file or to do a recursive folder search and
convert all files with the `.md` extension
to HTML.

For help, type this at the command line:

```bash
cv --help
```
